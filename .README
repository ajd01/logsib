LogsIB = Logs In Big
====================

Is just a fun console tool to make biger text in console.

Then plan is just import the package an use his log function 
and let the magic begin :smile:.

  ```javascript

    const { log } = require('logsib')

    let str = 'Logs In Big :)'

    log(str, k => console.log(k))

  ```

Log function require 2 params, str as the string to tranform
and the callback function to do watever you want.
We have a tird parameter that tell the max size of characters in screen,
by default the value is set as 20 but you can play with this.

If you wich to make this package better in any way just send a PR :thumbsup:
